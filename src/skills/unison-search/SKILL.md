# Unison Search

Search the Unison brain for past coding sessions, decisions, and saved information.

## How to Search

Run the search script with the user's query and optional scope flag:

```bash
node ~/.codex/unison/search-memory.js [--user|--project|--both|--tag <tag>] "USER_QUERY_HERE"
```

### Scope Flags

- `--both` (default): Search both personal and project memories in parallel
- `--user`: Search personal/user memories across sessions
- `--project`: Search project-specific memories
- `--tag <tag>`: Search a specific custom tag (see `[UNISON TAGS]` in your context for available tags)

### Options

- `--no-profile`: Skip fetching the user profile summary (included by default)

## Examples

- User asks "what did I work on yesterday":

  ```bash
  node ~/.codex/unison/search-memory.js "work yesterday recent activity"
  ```

- User asks "how did we implement auth" (project-specific):

  ```bash
  node ~/.codex/unison/search-memory.js --project "authentication implementation"
  ```

- User asks "what are my coding preferences":
  ```bash
  node ~/.codex/unison/search-memory.js --user "coding preferences style"
  ```

## Present Results

The script outputs formatted memory results with relevance information. Present them clearly to the user and offer to search again with different terms if needed.
